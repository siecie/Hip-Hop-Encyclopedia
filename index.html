    <p>Afrika Bambaataa wanted to make change to his community for the better. He is known as one of the Grandfathers of hip hop, due to his major impacts of pushing kids to learn to express themselves in a healthy way. Soon there were rap battles instead of gang fights, and gangs were later known as social clubs. These changes in these communities helped lead to the success of hip hop in today's society. Hip hop and rap are vastly different to any other art form just based on the meaning behind them. The struggles of racism, police brutality, gang violence, and oppression all lead to the creation of one of the greatest music and dance forms.</p>
