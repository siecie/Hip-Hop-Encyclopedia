      <p> The hip hop and rap scene seems to be taking over pop culture. More and more celebrities seem to be dipping their toes into this genre. Hip hop is not just a genre, it is a lifestyle, and more importantly a culture for so many people. This culture is built on the trials and tribulations of what African Americans went through in the 70s. They used their hardship and pain to create a new way of expression that did not lead to violence. The violence in these communities was a big issue. There were gang wars, police brutality, and drug deals gone wrong. African Americans were using violence to release their anger for being oppressed and put aside from society; they were seen as others instead of humans.</p>
      <h2> Elements</h2>
      <p> Hip hop has four major elements: DJing, MCing, graffiti, and b-boys/b-girls. DJs play a major role in all this, because they are the ones providing remixes and music. These DJs have to learn from the crowd on what to play, they play a new beat and see if it causes more people to start dancing, or allows b-boys and b-girls to try out new moves. The role of the DJ is to keep the crowd moving, each DJ has to know what it will take to do so. Also, there were MCs that helped with crowd involvement. These MC’s were there to aid the DJs, they would spark rhymes and engage with the crowd and the DJ. There was a special dynamic between an MC and a DJ, but as technology advanced soon the MC’s were gaining more fame than the DJs, and soon were performing solos using recorded tapes. These MC’s had to be versatile, make a social impact, be a master of substance, and have high energy live performances. Graffiti was a way for these communities to come alive, for example the Bronx. These run down buildings, homes, and trains were an eyesore for these cities, the graffiti artists brought those things to life. “Archaeologists first used the term “graffiti” to describe the system of communication and expression depicted by writings, drawings, and scribbling on surfaces” (Prince and Emmett 28). </p>
